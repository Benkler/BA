\label{ch:StateOfTheArt}
This chapter outlines the current state of the art regarding microservice identification.  Sec. \ref{sec:StateOfTheArt:LiteratureReview} presents the search strategy and several existing approaches (Table \ref{tab:overviewLiterature}) that deal with the identification of microservices. Thereupon, the approaches are further explained and finally compared on the basis of several criteria.

\section{Literature Review}
\label{sec:StateOfTheArt:LiteratureReview}
The approaches mentioned in table \ref{tab:overviewLiterature} are the result of an extensive literature research which was conducted using the digital libraries IEEE \footnote{http://ieeexplore.ieee.org }, ACM \footnote{http://portal.acm.org} and SpringerLink \footnote{http://www.springerlink.com }. The web search enginge Google Scholar \footnote{http://scholar.google.com} provided further approaches and general information. \cite{FunctionalDecompositionHeinrich} was provided by the supervisor of this thesis and \cite{ServiceCutter} was cited by various approaches, including \cite{interfaceAnalysisBaresi}. The following search string was used: 

\vspace{1cm}
\begin{centering}
{\itshape
   ["identify" OR "identification" OR "migrating" OR "monolith" OR "decomposition" OR "decompose monolith"
  	OR "decompose"] AND  "microservice"  \\
  	   OR \\  "microservice"  AND ["identification" OR "transformation" OR "refactor"]
} \\

 
   
\end{centering}
\vspace{1cm}

\noindent
Table \ref{tab:overviewLiterature} presents the 8 most promising approaches in the area of microservice identification. Other papers like \cite{TowardsCloudGuiseppe} only presented a conceptual train of thought, whereas \cite{MigratingCloud}, for instance, focuses on migrating strategies on infrastructural level. This thesis mainly focus on the identification part and disregards the actual implementation and deployment process afterwards. \\
To compare the available approaches, criteria have to be defined. Sec.\ref{sec:stateOfTheArt:comparison} introduces 8 criteria and explains why they take part in the comparison. The comparison itself is done by applying the criteria to each approach using Table \ref{tab:compareApproaches1} and \ref{tab:compareApproaches2}. Incidentally, the comparison including some criteria are inspired by the work of \cite{ClassificationOfRefactoring}
Further information is given in textual form in the same section.

\section{Approaches}
\label{sec:stateOfTheArt:approaches}
The following section provides a short introduction in the approaches mentioned in table \ref{tab:overviewLiterature}. 

\noindent
\textbf{Extraction of Microservices from Monolithic Software Architectures   } \\
The approach presented in \cite{ExtractionMazlami} is a class based extraction model, that uses (meta-)information of a version control system \textit{(VCS)} such as Git\footnote{https://github.com/} to identify microservices. The approach is divided in two phases: The \textit{Construction Phase} and the \textit{Clustering Phase}.
Starting with a given code base, the approach uses three different coupling strategies and the information provided by the \textit{VCS} to transform the monolith into a weighted graph. Here, the nodes represent classes, and the edges have weights according to the chosen coupling strategy. In the second phase, a clustering algorithm determines possible microservices (each cluster is a microservice candidate). \\

\noindent
\textbf{Object-Aware Identification of Microservice  } \\
\cite{ObjectAwareAmiri} identifies microservices from business processes, using the widely known \textit{Business Process and Model Notation (BPMN)}. The approach uses clustering based on structural dependency and data object dependency. The first aspect is extracted from related activities within the business process model. A relation exists, if an edge directly connects a pair of activities or if only gateways are in between. \\
The latter aspect is based on the data object read and writes of each activity. Activities that are directly or indirectly connected and perform write or read operations are more likely to partition into the same microservice. \\


\noindent
\textbf{Microservices Identification Through Interface Analysis   } \\
In \cite{interfaceAnalysisBaresi}, the author proposes an approach that is based on semantic similarity of functionality specified through OpenApi\footnote{https://www.openapis.org/} specifications (OpenApi defines a language-agnostic, standardized and machine-readable interface for RESTful APIs). The similarity depends on a reference vocabulary: each operation of the specification is analysed along with its resources (parameters, return values, complex types) and mapped to a concept of the chosen reference vocabulary. Each mapping has a score, based on a fitness function that uses the collocation of words (called terms) found in the operation and in the concepts. A co-occurrence matrix contains all mappings of possible pairs of terms and concepts. It is maximized to obtain the best mappings. Finally, this approach identifies potential candidate microservices, as fine-grained groups of operations, that are mapped to the same reference concept. \\


\noindent
\textbf{Identifying Microservices Using Functional Decomposition  } \\
The approach presented in \cite{FunctionalDecompositionHeinrich} identifies microservices by functional decomposition of the software requirements, provided as use case specifications. In order to achieve the decomposition, the system is  modelled as a finite set of \textit{system operations} and the system's \textit{state space}. Use cases provide the necessary input data: Verbs found in the use cases serve as \textit{system operations} and nouns correspond to the \textit{state variables} that the operations read or write. The state variables constitute the state space. Relationships between the operations and the variables are store in a relation table, that is visualized as a weighted graph. Finally, the approach uses graph analyse tools to determine clusters, where each cluster is a potential candidate of a microservice that fulfils the criteria of low coupling and high cohesion. \\



\noindent
\textbf{Partitioning Microservices: A Domain Engineering Approach } \\
Munezaro et al. \cite{DomainEngineeringMunezero} propose an approach to identify appropriate microservices using \textit{Domain-driven Design (DDD)} patterns. As a prerequisite, developers define a domain by using ubiquitous language. The domain indicates what the system does, precisely the system responsibilities, and what functionality it must implement. Domain experts define the boundaries of each responsibility and make it as a \textit{business capability}, where a business capability is something that a system does in order to generate value. Each business capability is a microservice. When defining the boundary, the focus is on the relationships among the responsibilities to minimize cross-cutting transactions. \\

\noindent
\textbf{From Monolith to Microservices: A Dataflow-Driven Approach } \\
\cite{DataflowDrivenChen} uses a top-down data flow driven decomposition approach to determine high cohesive and loosely coupled microservices. Before the actual identification process starts, a \textit{Data Flow Diagram (DFD)} needs to be constructed on the users' natural language description of the system to illustrate the detailed data flow. The first step of the approach consist of manually constructing a purified DFD, which focuses on data's semanteme and operations only. Afterwards, the purified DFD is algorithmically transformed into a decomposable DFD which is finally used to extract potential microservice candidates. \\


\noindent
\textbf{Function-Splitting Heuristics for Discovery of Microservices in Enterprise Systems  } \\
\cite{HeuristicsAlwis} is an approach that utilizes heuristics to specify two fundamental areas of microservice discovery: Function splitting based on common object subtypes and functional splitting based on common execution fragments across software. \\
The discovery process consists of two steps: First, the code, database tables and the SQL queries are evaluated to identify business objects and their relationships. Along with a set of given execution call graphs (different sequences of operations; generated though e.g. analysing log data), the information found is passed to the second part of the process. Algorithms processes the call graphs of the legacy system to derive a set of subgraphs and analyse which fragments are related to the same business objects in order to recommend possible microservices. \\

\noindent
\textbf{Service Cutter: A Systematic Approach to Service Decomposition  } \\
Gysel et al. \cite{ServiceCutter} introduce a service decomposition tool based on 16 coupling criteria coming from industry and literature. A coupling criterion is a decision driver to decide whether data, operations or artifacts (generalized under the term \textit{nanoentity}) should or should not be owned and exposed by the same service. Additionally, each criterion has a different score according to its priority.
The input is in form of various \textit{System Specification Artifacts (SSAs)}, such as domain models and use cases.  The tool \textit{Service Cutter} extracts coupling criteria information out of it, that must be prioritised by a user. To analyse and process the coupling criteria, Service Cutter creates a weighted graph. The nodes represent the nanoentities and the weights on and edge is the sum of all scores per criterion, multiplied by a user defined priority. In the end, an exchangeable clustering algorithm identifies potential microservice candidates where each cluster correspond to a high cohesive and loosely coupled service.
 
\section{Comparison} 
\label{sec:stateOfTheArt:comparison}

Table \ref{tab:compareApproaches1} and \ref{tab:compareApproaches2} provide a short description of the identified approaches mentioned above regarding some comparison criteria. The following criteria were used: \textbf{Basis Concept} recaptures the underlying approach of the microservice identification for classification purposes. \textbf{Prerequisites} presents the necessary preconditions for the success of the approach. For example, the approach mentioned in \cite{ExtractionMazlami} cannot be used without meaningful VCS\footnote{Version Control System} data. The \textbf{Input} row describes the type and amount of input that is used realize the approach, i.e. Data Flow Diagrams in \cite{DataflowDrivenChen}. The row \textbf{Tool Support} indicates, whether the approach has been implemented or if other supporting tools are available to simplify the identification of high cohesive and loosely coupled microservices. The \textbf{Degree of human involvement} is part of the comparison, as this thesis aims to reduce the complexity of the service identification while keeping the required amount of expertise and manual tasks on a minimum. As evaluated in Sec.\ref{sec:background:microservices}, defining fine-grained microservices is a key challenge. Therefore, the approaches need to be compared in regard to the \textbf{Granularity of the recommended Microservices}. Some approaches allow an adjustable level of the granularity (e.g. \cite{ExtractionMazlami}), whereas others generate a predefined granularity (e.g. always the most fine-grained microservice candidates \cite{HeuristicsAlwis}). \textbf{Validation} compares how the approaches are validated to strengthen the credibility of the individual results. Each approach might have some drawbacks regarding it's applicability to universal systems, required amount and type of input, user interaction and further expertise. \textbf{Limitations} is meant to point out the identified drawbacks. The following paragraph replenishes and explains the results given in \ref{tab:compareApproaches1} and \ref{tab:compareApproaches2} shortly. \\

The approach mentioned in \cite{ExtractionMazlami} is the result of a master thesis \cite{Mazlami}. Therefore, the degree of available information is larger compared to other approaches. The algorithmic recommendation of microservices candidates is implemented in a web-based, open source prototype and permits to choose three different coupling criteria, which can be combined for better results. Nevertheless, the main limitation relies in its type of input data: meaningful VCS data. For instance, developers must not commit changes on two independent functionalities together, but split it up. If this is not the case, the outcome may be wrong. \\

Amiri's approach \cite{ObjectAwareAmiri} does not provide tool support at all. Further, information about the validation process (i.e. tested systems) are not given. The weighting of the relationships lack formal explanation and need further analysis. Nonetheless, the approach is straightforward and does not require any user involvement once the input data is available. \\

Baresi et al. \cite{interfaceAnalysisBaresi} developed an experimental prototype to validate their results. They used a multitude of specifications and compared the outcome  with results of software engineers and the tool \textit{Service Cutter} \cite{ServiceCutter}. Nevertheless, the outcome highly depends on the chosen reference vocabulary and  well-defined APIs in the legacy system. Operations and resources (variables, return values) have to be expressive and represent what they do. Variable names like \textit{temp} or \textit{var1} would result in a useless service decomposition. \\

\cite{FunctionalDecompositionHeinrich} uses external tools to realize the approach. Once the operations and state variable are identified, the identification method is universally applicable to all sort of legacy systems and also greenfield applications\footnote{Project which lacks any constraints imposed by legacy systems}. Nonetheless, identifying relevant nouns and verbs that represent the operations and state variables is only partly supported by tools. It still requires human expertise to eliminate duplicates and identify ambiguities. \\

Munezero et al. present a conceptional approach based on DDD patterns.\footnote{Domain-driven Design}. Although the domain-driven design approach is currently the most common technique for identifying microservices (\cite{FunctionalDecompositionHeinrich}\cite{Fowler}\cite{MigratingTowardsSurvey} and more), it does not solve the problem statements (precisely \textit{PS2}) mentioned in Sec.\ref{sec:Introduction:ProblemStatement}, as it requires the expertise experience and of domain experts.\\

Chen's semi-automate approach \cite{DataflowDrivenChen} is based on Data-flow Diagrams. Transforming the traditional DFDs to purified DFDs is not trivial an therefore requires a vast amount of additional manual work. Nevertheless, the purified DFD represents the real information flow of the corresponding business logic in the legacy system and therefore provides valuable information regarding potential inter- and intra service communication. \\

\cite{HeuristicsAlwis} is a more complex method for microservice identification: Many steps and 
prerequisites are necessary to prepare the input data. For example, expressive \textit{Log Files} are required to generate call graphs. Further,source code and the system's database is required to identify so-called business objects and their relationships. The latter one lacks a formal description in the paper. 
Additionally, the algorithms to identify potential microservice candidates are solely provided conceptually without further tool support. \\

\textit{Service Cutter} \cite{ServiceCutter} is a mature open-source software with available wiki. It was the first attempt to automatize service extraction and is therefore a reference project for other approaches like \cite{ExtractionMazlami} and \cite{DataflowDrivenChen}. It uses 16 coupling criteria extracted from industrial experience and knowledge to decompose a system into services. However, the input requires special formats and consequently extensive and time consuming preparation.
