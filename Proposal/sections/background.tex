\section{Monolithic Software Architecture}
\label{sec:background:monolith}
The monolithic software architecture is a well-known and the most widely used pattern for Enterprise Applications, which usually are built in three main parts (top to bottom): The client-side user interface (Tier 3), the server-side application (Tier 2) and the persistence layer (Tier 1). The server-side application - \textit{the monolith} - is a single unit and deployed on one application server \cite{infoq}. The software structure, if well defined, is composed of self-contained modules (i.e. software components), where each module consists of a set of functions \cite{HeuristicsAlwis}.
The monolith implements a complex domain model, including all functions, many domain entities and their relationships.
For small applications, this approach works relatively well. They are simple to develop, test and deploy \cite{FunctionalDecompositionHeinrich}. Fast prototyping is supported by the current frameworks and development environments (IDE), which are still oriented around developing single applications \cite{infoq}.
\\
But once they grow in size, they become exceedingly difficult to understand and hard to maintain without reasonable effort \cite{FunctionalDecompositionHeinrich} \cite{ClassificationOfRefactoring}. A complex and large code base prevents a fast addition of new features and makes the application risky and expensive to evolve \cite{TowardsTechnique}.
Alterations to the system, even though they might be small, result in a redeployment of the whole monolith application due to its nature being a single unit \cite{FunctionalDecompositionHeinrich}. Moreover, it is difficult to adopt newer technologies without rewriting the whole application, as monolith are build on a specific technology stack \cite{infoq} \cite{ExtractionMazlami}.\\
Scaling is only possible by duplicating the entire application  - namely \textit{horizontal scaling}. Consequently, large portions of the infrastructure remains unused, if only parts of the application need to be upscaled or even used \cite{EnticeApproach} \cite{MigratingTowardsSurvey}. \\
Chen et al. provide a short résumé:

\subsection{Definition}
The above quotation is a widely adopted definition of the term \textit{Microservice}, provided by M. Fowler and J. Lewis, the pioneers of the microservice architecture. However, the term is not formally defined. Amiri et al. describes microservices as a collection of cohesive and loosely coupled components, where each service implements a business capability.
 The author introduces three principles upon which the architecture is build: \textit{Bounded Context, Size, Independence} \cite{ObjectAwareAmiri}. \\
 The first principle is about related functionality, that is combined in a single business capability - the  \textit{bounded context} \cite{FunctionalDecompositionHeinrich}. Each capability is implemented by one microservice. 
The \textit{Size} of a microservice is defined by the number of features it provides (namely bundled functional capabilities)  \cite{WorkloadbasedClustering}. There is no consensus about the "proper" size of a microservice \cite{DomainEngineeringMunezero}, but several guidelines exists: Services should focus on one business capability only \cite{ObjectAwareAmiri}. Others state, that the size of a microservice should not exceed a level, where it cannot be rewritten within six weeks \cite{WorkloadbasedClustering}. However, the sizes vary from system to system \cite{FunctionalDecompositionHeinrich} and even different sizes for each microservice in a specific system are possible \cite{DomainEngineeringMunezero}. The bottom line of \textit{Independence} is in Amiri's description of microservices as "a collection of high cohesive and loosely coupled components" \cite{ObjectAwareAmiri}. High cohesive services implement a relatively independent piece of business logic (at the most one business capability). Further, microservices should hardly depend on each other, which is the idea of being loosely coupled \cite{DataflowDrivenChen}.
\\
Communication between microservices is achieved by lightweight message passing mechanisms such as \textit{REST}. Each service exposes a well defined interface (\textit{API}) with endpoints that provide information using standard data formats \cite{FunctionalDecompositionHeinrich}. 
The design of microservices mainly follows the \textit{Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)}: Each service should not have more than one reason to change \cite{TowardsUnderstandingEvolution}. The SRP mainly corresponds to the idea of not implementing more than one business capability.
The following covers the benefits and challenges of the microservice architecture.

\subsection{Benefits}
\textbf{Fast and Independent Deployment} \\
As a matter of fact, each microservice is deployed independently \cite{interfaceAnalysisBaresi}. Changes to the code do not result in a full redeployment of the entire application \cite{FunctionalDecompositionHeinrich}. Consequently, software developers are able to react much quicker to changes in business requirements. This includes an acceleration in error correction. Per contra, any changes in a monolithic code base requires a time consuming build of a new version and the redeployment of the entire application \cite{Fowler}. \\

\noindent
\textbf{Availability, Resilience and Fault Isolation} \\
Microservices are designed to operate independently of each other and to tolerate failure of services \cite{Fowler}. Large parts of the application remain unaffected of partly failures and the availability of the system is, at least partly guaranteed. Monolithic application do not provide this type of fault isolation. If a failure occurs, the whole application remains unavailable as it is usually running in a single process \cite{ExtractionMazlami}. 
 
\noindent
\textbf{Scalability and Resource Utilisation} \\
Small and independent microservices allow more fine-granular horizontal scaling \cite{WorkloadbasedClustering}. Single services can be duplicated to cope with changing workload during runtime \cite{DataflowDrivenChen}. Thus, dynamic (de-)allocation of resources on demand prevent infrastructure from being idle \cite{HeuristicsAlwis}. Scaling monoliths can only be attained by duplicating the entire application , leaving resources unused \cite{ClassificationOfRefactoring}. Further, each microservice is deployed on the best suitable infrastructure for its needs, allowing a more efficient system organization \cite{infoq}. \\

\noindent
\textbf{Improved Productivity} \\
In traditional software development, teams are divided based on their expertise: Database architects, UI-developers and server-side engineers, resulting in a three-tiered application (cf. Sec.\ref{sec:background:monolith}). Additionally, software engineers are responsible for the development only. Deployment is part of the operations team. This team structure results in high communication overhead and slows down the productivity \cite{Mazlami}. \\
In contrast, microservices are organized around business capabilities requiring cross-functional and independent teams \cite{ObjectAwareAmiri}. Each team has the full range of skills required for the end-to-end realization of a microservice, including UI-development, database architecture, back-end engineers and project management. 
This minimizes the communication and interaction between the teams and thus, speeds up the productivity. Ultimately, microservices enable a more agile flow of development and operation \cite{ClassificationOfRefactoring}, also referred as \textit{DevOps}. 
\\


\noindent
\textbf{Neutral development technology} \\
Microservices are highly decoupled from each other, as they use standardized and lightweight communication mechanisms such as REST \cite{FunctionalDecompositionHeinrich}. Microservices can be realized using different programming languages, technologies and even deployment environments \cite{DataflowDrivenChen}. Developers are consequently not longer limited to use a single technology for the whole application. They can choose the most appropriate technology for each particular business problem or try out some new technology without rewriting the whole application \cite{ServiceCutter} \cite{TowardsTechnique}.
