Powered by the rise of cloud computing, agile development, DevOps and continuous deployment strategies, the microservice architectural pattern emerged as an alternative to monolithic software design. Microservices, as a suite of independent, highly cohesive and loosely coupled services, overcome the shortcoming of centralized monolithic architectures. Therefore, prominent companies recently migrated their monolithic legacy applications successfully to microservice-based architecture. They key challenge is to find an appropriate partition of legacy applications - namely \textit{microservice identification}. So far, the identification process is done intuitively based on the experience of system architects and software engineers - mainly by virtue of missing formal approaches and a lack of automated tool support. \\
However, when application grow in size and become progressively complex, it is quite demanding to decompose the system in appropriate microservices.
To tackle this challenge, the thesis provides a formal, graph-based identification approach using clustering techniques. Based on the business point of view, the approach identifies structural dependencies and data object dependencies to build a weighted graph. Clustering tools identify clusters that correspond to possible microservice candidates. To evaluate the quality and the effect of the process, the approach is applied to a case study that has already been decomposed into several microservices.
