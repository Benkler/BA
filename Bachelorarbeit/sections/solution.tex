\section{Basic Approach}




\section{Distance Metric}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Determine distance between pair of Objects in BPMN (Count activities in between)
	\item Basic Idea: Data accessed more successively is more connected and belongs to same service
	\item Pro: Easy
	\item: Contra: Not really Data Flow; pair  occurs several times --> On time close, other times far away, what about average?
\end{itemize}

\section{Count Activities Metric}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Count activities that access a pair of objects in BPMN
	\item Basic Idea: Data frequently accessed together is more connected and belongs to the same service
	\item Pro: represents idea of data cohesiveness
	\item Contra: Again activities (no clean data flow) but nothing else!

\end{itemize}
